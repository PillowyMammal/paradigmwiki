So, you’re overwhelmed, lost, and in need of a guiding hand for warframe?
Fuck me too man, lmao.
If you're reading this, then that means you either just finished The Sacrifice or you are Theory. Congrats!

At this point, you should have a full suite of:
###### Standard Warframe Mods
- Vitality, Redirection, Steel Fiber
- Intensify, Streamline, Stretch, Continuity, Flow
- Umbral Mods: Umbral Intensify, Umbral Vitality, Umbral Fiber
###### Standard Weapon Mods
Primary Rifle
- Serration, Split Chamber, Point Strike, Vital Sense, Cryo Rounds/Stormbringer/Infected Clip/Hellfire, Rifle Aptitude, Speed Trigger
Primary Shotgun
- Point Blank, Hell's Chamber, Ravage, Blunderbuss, Shotgun Savvy, Contagious Spread/Incenddiary Coat/Chilling Grasp/Charged Shell
Secondary
- Hornet Strike, Target Cracker, Pistol Gambit, Sure Shot, Barrel Diffusion, Heated Charge/Pathogen Rounds/Convulsion/Deep Freeze
Melee
- Pressure Point, Berserker Fury, Fury, Reach, True Steel, Melee Prowess, Organ Shatter, Blood Rush
- Umbral Mods: Sacrifical Steel and Sacrifical Pressure

If you don't have some of these, most of them are obtainable just through regular play. Just keep going through missions (especially if you're trying to unlock Steel Path) and eventually you will have all of these.

### My Two Cents
Here's a very important thing to keep in mind:
**Do the Normal Duviri Circuit once you unlock it!**
Duviri Circuit will give you not only hard to grind warframes, but will also give you some nice arcanes and some of the mods that I will talk about later. Make sure to do them, its a very good weekly activity!
The Steel Path version is better, giving you access to Incarnons, better arcanes, and even boosters. The Circuits reset each Sunday at 8pm EST.

# The Checklist
- Unlock Steel Path - Complete the Starchart
Literally the most important thing you can do, the game opens up from there with many options. It's easy to speedrun through a bunch of missions if you never finished, you only need to complete each once.

An important note, if you see a little * next to something, that means I am pointing it out as something important to get.

## Warframes
These are my recommendations for some easy to get, standard warframes. Some of them I will recommend their Primes over the base frame if its easier to get, but always keep in mind these things:
1. All warframes are viable, even the ones considered "not so good."
2. Every warframe has a job, some just have more jobs than others.
3. Always go for what you think looks or sounds cool, don't force yourself to play a warframe you don't like.
4. Primes are upgrades, but not by that much. Don’t feel the need to grind for them if you don’t want to. The only time you should grind for primes is either for money or because the base warframe has a bullshit farm (i.e Harrow having the worst drop rates for parts, literally chassis is 0.02% who thought that was a good idea???)
I am also going to give these Warframes classes, but this is not entirely what the community may believe. I am just giving them these so that you guys can have an idea of what the warframe does before farming.
Key:
- Weapon Platform (WP): a Warframe with a strong self buff or buffs its weapons in some way.
- Support: Warframe that is able to buff and heal allies.
- Caster: a Warframe that focuses entirely on its abilities to deal damage.
- Exalted: a warframe with an Exalted weapon, a weapon which has its own build slot in the arsenal and is effected by both weapon mods and ability mods. This weapon is always summoned via an ability the warframe can use.
- Tank: warframes with an ability or several that makes them effectively immortal.
- Looter: a warframe that usually buffs loot chances. Not their only build, but definitely what they’re known for.
- Nuke: a warframe that can easily clear rooms and tiles

## Important Vendor Items
A list of specific vendor items to watch out for.

###### The Cambion Drift
- Helminth Segment*** - Rank 3 Entrati
- Voidrig* - Rank 2 Necraloid
- Mausolon - Rank 2 Necraloid
###### The Holdfasts
- Phenmor - Rank 2 Zariman
- Praedos - Rank 4 Zariman
- Molt Augmented - Rank 5 Zariman
- Arcane Amp Adaptor - Rank 5 Zariman
###### The Quills
- Shwaak Prism - Rank 2 Quills
- Phahd Scaffold - Rank 5 Quills
- Lohrin Brace - Rank 3 Quills
- Magus Vigor
- Magus Husk
- Virtuous Shadow
This build is referred to as 243 and is a great early Eidolon hunting amp.
###### Vox Solari
- Rank 5 Fortuna to unlock
- Archgun Summoning - complete Profit-Taker once to unlock
- Klamora Prism, Propa Scaffold, Certus Brace - Rank 5 Vox (this makes the current meta for amps, the 777, but you can also make a 277 since the klamora is a little difficult to use)
###### Sanctum Anatomica
- Melee Arcanes
- Necramech Mods
- Helminth Coalescent Segment - Rank 2 Cavia

## Archwing
There are only 4 archwings so this segment will be short. (They’re not so much bad as they are just kinda useless. Archwing content isn’t relevant nor has it been in awhile, so really you get these just to have something to level or because an ability is useful for other things).
- Itzal - the fastest archwing - Tenno Dojo
- Amesha - the healing/immortal archwing - Tenno Dojo
- Elytron - the DPS archwing - Tenno Dojo
There is an Odonata Prime but it’s not really worth forking over the money for it outside of just collecting it/mastery rank fodder.

###### Archguns
These are actually the only things that are relevant from Archwing, as they are used outside of it. Once you unlock the Vox Solari by being Rank 5 in Fortuna, you can summon an Archgun in any mission! These are also used on your Necramechs.
- Mausolon* - definitely the best, obtained from completing your first Necramech
- Morgha - Entrati Rank 3
- Cortege - Entrati Rank 4
- Kuva Ayanga - Liches
- Kuva Grattler - Liches
- Larkspur (Prime) - Tenno Dojo (Prime is void relics)
- Corvas (Prime) - Tenno Dojo (Prime is void relics)
- Fluctus - Tenno Dojo
Larkspur, Corvas and Fluctus are best for starting out, as they're easy to acquire early on. Just go for whichever feels best to use, and move on as you get the ability to obtain others.

###### Archmelees
Honestly, these are worthless. Only get them to rank up to level 30. 
If you can get your hands on a Prisma Veritrux that's the only one you'll ever need. Can either be bought in trade chat or from Baro Ki'Teer when he comes around. 
Otherwise just use the Centaur from the Tenno Dojo, that one was the best before Prisma Veritrux came around.

### Mods
###### Archwing
- Enhanced Durability
- Energy Inversion
- Argon Plating
- Morphic Transformer/Primed Morphic Transformer

###### Archmelee
Don't worry too much about gettting these. Archmelee is absolutely worthless. If you have them, great. If not, don't sweat it. I wouldn't even recommend you invest the endo into anything other than Cutting Edge and maybe Furor and Tempered Blade.
- Astral Autopsy
- Cutting Edge
- Bleeding Edge
- Extend
- Sudden Impact

- Poisonous Sting/Glacial Edge/Conductive Blade/Blazing Steel
- Critical Meltdown

## Operators
Ideally, you should get all of the Way-Bounds (operator skills that act as passives that apply no matter what school you are) but here are some of the best to focus, as well as three very important school you should focus into.

### Way-Bounds
- Last Gasp*** - Unairu (I cannot stress how important this one is)
- Void Flow - Zenurik
- Mind Step - Naramon
- Enduring Tides - Vazarin
- Inner Gaze - Madurai

### Three Important Schools
Luckily, you can always switch between schools, and ideally you should be maxxing all of them, but which should you focus on? My recommendation would be to start with Zenurik.
Zenurik:
- Gives you energy regen and ability strength.
- Is very simple to use and farm since the energy skills are cheaper and not way-bounds.
- The two way-bounds in Zenurik very easily give your operator a power boost.
Afterwards, I would suggest either Naramon or Madurai, depending on what you're doing.
Naramon:
- Boosts Warframe power, especially melee prowess.
- Helps with leveling things faster as it boosts exp for melee kills.
- Increases operator movement with it's way-bounds, Far Sling is fun to use.
Madurai:
- Boosts Operator combat prowess.
- One of the few straight up buffs to amp damage.
- Great for if you want to get into Eidolon Hunts/Angel Farming.
- It's way-bounds are alright but Eternal Gaze is a great QoL passive.

TLDR if you like melee and want more melee damage, go Naramon next. If you want to do Eidolon hunts more effectively, go Madurai
